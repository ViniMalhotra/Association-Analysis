# Association-Analysis
Performing Association Analysis by implementing the following algorithms:  Eclat algorithm ( to find all itemsets of size 3 or larger that are frequent) , GenMax algorithm (to find all the maximal frequent itemsets in this dataset), Charms Algorithm (to find all the closed itemsets), FP-Tree algorithm (to construct the FP Tree for the given set of transactions)
